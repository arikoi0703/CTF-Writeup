## useful online tool

#### For code convert
- https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html
> Converter between ascii, hex, octal, binary, decimal, and base64.  
> can do some Fraction.
> can NOT convert octal to ascii directly, in this case, use [this](http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/octal/), or turn octal into decimal first.  

#### For cryptography
