# CTFs' writeup

## useful online tool

#### For code convert
1. https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html
> Converter between ascii, hex, octal, binary, decimal, and base64.  
> can do some Fraction.
> can NOT convert octal to ascii directly, in this case, use [this](http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/octal/), or turn octal into decimal first.  

#### For cryptography
1. https://cryptii.com/
> deal with ROT13, vigenere, morse code, and so on.
> include bas64, url encode
2. https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx
> for QRL
3. https://www.cryptool.org/en/cto-highlights/rsa-step-by-step
> show the RSA evry arguments, step by step.
> include encrypt/decrypt
4. https://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM
> deal whit Integer factorization, for large number.
5. https://www.quipqiup.com/
> for substitution cipher, try it first for substitution cipher.

#### For forensics
1. https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/
> steganography only.

#### For code
1. https://codebeautify.org/
